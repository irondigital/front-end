        <h1>what is node js?</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Node.js is a free, open-source JavaScript runtime that runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and more.

It lets you execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side development with JavaScript.

Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js is designed for building scalable network applications efficiently.</p>

     <h2> example: print a message</h2>
     <p>console.log('Hello from Node.js!');</p>
     <button> try itself</button>


    <h1>why node js</h1>
    <p>
  Node.js excels at handling many simultaneous connections with minimal overhead, making it perfect for:

Real-time applications (chats, gaming, collaboration tools)
APIs and microservices
Data streaming applications
Command-line tools
Server-side web applications
Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it highly efficient for I/O-heavy workloads.
