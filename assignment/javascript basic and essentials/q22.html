The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface provided by the browser that represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects.
Each part of an HTML document — like elements, attributes, and text — becomes a node in this tree.


In this example, the <html>, <body>, <h1>, and <p> tags are all represented as nodes in the DOM tree. JavaScript can interact with these nodes to manipulate the content, structure, and style of the web page dynamically.
JavaScript provides several methods to interact with the DOM, such as:
1. getElementById(): Selects an element by its ID.          
2. getElementsByClassName(): Selects elements by their class name.
3. getElementsByTagName(): Selects elements by their tag name.
4. querySelector(): Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
5. querySelectorAll(): Selects all elements that match a CSS selector.
Here is an example of how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>DOM Manipulation Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>DOM Manipulation Example</h2>
  <p id="myParagraph">This is the original paragraph.</p>
  <button id="changeTextButton">Change Text</button>

  <script>
    // Get the paragraph and button elements
    const paragraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');
    const button = document.getElementById('changeTextButton');

    // Add a click event listener to the button
    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
      // Change the text content of the paragraph
      paragraph.textContent = 'The text has been changed!';
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
