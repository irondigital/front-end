What are JavaScript Events?

JavaScript events are actions or occurrences that happen in the web browser, which can be detected and responded to using JavaScript. These events can be triggered by user interactions, such as clicking a button, moving the mouse, pressing a key, or submitting a form. They can also be triggered by other actions, such as loading a webpage or resizing the browser window. 
When an event occurs, it can be handled using event listeners or event handlers, which are functions that execute in response to the event. This allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications by responding to user actions and other events in real-time. Common JavaScript events include "click", "mouseover", "keydown", "load", and "submit", among many others.
Events can be categorized into several types, including:
1. Mouse Events: Triggered by mouse actions (e.g., click, dblclick, mouseover, mouseout).
2. Keyboard Events: Triggered by keyboard actions (e.g., keydown, keyup, keypress).
3. Form Events: Triggered by form actions (e.g., submit, change, focus, blur).
4. Window Events: Triggered by window actions (e.g., load, resize, scroll, unload).
5. Touch Events: Triggered by touch actions on mobile devices (e.g., touchstart, touchmove, touchend).
6. Clipboard Events: Triggered by clipboard actions (e.g., copy, cut, paste).
Here is an example of how to use JavaScript events to handle a button click:

  <h2>JavaScript Events Example</h2>
  <button id="myButton">Click Me!</button>
  <p id="displayText"></p>

  <script>
    // Get the button and paragraph elements
    const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
    const displayText = document.getElementById('displayText');

    // Add a click event listener to the button
    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
      displayText.textContent = 'Button was clicked!';
    });
  </script>
</body>
