Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
By default, JavaScript code runs from top to bottom, line by line.

However, control flow statements like if, else, for, while, and switch let you change the normal order of execution — for example, by making decisions or repeating code.

if–else Statement:

The if–else statement allows you to execute certain blocks of code based on conditions (true or false).

example:
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
    let age = 20;
    
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
  console.log("You are not eligible to vote yet.");
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
