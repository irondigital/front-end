1. while Loop:
The condition is checked first.

The loop runs only if the condition is true.

So, if the condition is false from the beginning, the loop never executes.

example:
<script>
    let i = 5;

while (i < 5) {
  console.log("This will NOT run");
  i++;
}

</script>

2. doâ€“while Loop:
The code block runs once before the condition is checked.
The loop will then continue to run as long as the condition is true.
example:

<script>
let x = 5;
do {
  console.log("This will run at least once");
} while (x < 5);

</script>
