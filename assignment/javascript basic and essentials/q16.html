An array in JavaScript is a special type of object used to store multiple values in a single variable.
Each value in an array is called an element, and every element has a numeric index starting from 0.

Arrays help organize and manage collections of related data (like numbers, names, or objects).
Example:
<html lang="en">        
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
        console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: Apple
        console.log(fruits.length); // Output: 3
    </script>
</body>
</html>

Arrays provide methods to manipulate data, such as adding, removing, or sorting elements.
