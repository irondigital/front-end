    A function in JavaScript is a block of code designed to perform a specific task.
Functions help you reuse code, make programs modular, and keep code organized.

You can define a function once and call it whenever you need it.

Syntax of Declaring a Function:
function functionName(parameters) {
  // code to be executed
}   

example:
<script>
    function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
greet("Alice"); // Calling the function with argument "Alice"   
    
</script>
