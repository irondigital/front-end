In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key–value pairs.
Each key (also called a property) is a string (or symbol), and each value can be any data type — a number, string, array, function, or even another object.

Objects are used to store and organize data in a structured way.

Example:
<html lang="en">        
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head> 
<body>
    <script>
        let person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false,
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
  }
};  
console.log(person.name); // Output: Alice
console.log(person.age);  // Output: 30
person.greet();          // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
    </script>
</body>
</html>
Objects allow you to group related data and functionality together, making your code more organized and easier to manage.
