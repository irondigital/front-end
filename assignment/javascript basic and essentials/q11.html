1. for Loop:
The for loop is used when you know how many times you want to run the code.

example:
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Count:", i);
}

    </script>
</body>
</html>

2. while Loop:
The while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a specified   condition is true.                              
example:

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        let i = 1;

while (i <= 5) {
  console.log("Number:", i);
  i++;
}

    </script>
</body>
</html>


do–while Loop:
The do–while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once before checking the condition.
example:            
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
let x = 10;

do {
  console.log("This runs once even though condition is false!");
} while (x < 5);


    </script>
</body>
</html>
