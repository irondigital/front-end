basically script tag is use for starting a js code like we can add all js code in script tag.
if it is html file then we can use script tag this is required and if we can work in js file then it was not required.

in html file we can access javascript in head and body tags:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <script></script>
</head>
<body>
    <script></script>
</body>
</html>

like:
 this is for external js file how can we add in our html file.
 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
