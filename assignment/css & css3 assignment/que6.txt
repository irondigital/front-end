CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a layout model in CSS that makes it easier to design flexible, responsive layouts.

it allows elements inside a container to be aligned, distributed, and spaced efficiently, even when their size is dynamic or unknown.


why this is useful ?

makes vertical and horizontal alignment simple.

handles spacing, resizing, and alignment of elements without float or positioning.

helps create responsive layouts that adapt to screen size.

flex-container:

the parent element that holds flex items.

it controls how the child elements (flex items) are laid out.

 we can use like 
display : flex;

flex-items:

the direct children of a flex container.

these are the elements that get positioned using Flexbox rules.
