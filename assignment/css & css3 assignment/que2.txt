CSS specificity is a set of rules used by browsers to determine which CSS rule to apply when multiple rules target the same element.

It is like a scoring system — the higher the score, the more specific the rule is, and that style will be applied.


How Conflicts Are Resolved:

highest specificity wins
if specificity is the same, the one defined last in the CSS file wins
inline styles override external or internal CSS
!important can override all — but should be used sparingly
