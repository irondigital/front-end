The CSS box model describes how every HTML element is structured and how spacing and sizing work in CSS.

Every element is considered as a rectangle box, made up of four components

content:

The actual content inside the element (text, image, input, etc.).

You can set its size using width and height.

Example: width: 200px; height: 100px;

padding:

The space between the content and the border.

Adds inside space around the content.

Example: padding: 10px; 

border:

A line surrounding the padding and content.

You can control its width, color, and style.

Example: border: 2px solid black;

margin:

The space outside the border, between this element and others.

Used to control spacing between elements.

Example: margin: 20px;
