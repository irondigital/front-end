Web-Safe Fonts:

Web-safe fonts are pre-installed on most devices and operating systems, like Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

Examples:

Arial

Times New Roman

Verdana

Georgia

Courier New

How they work:

When you use a web-safe font in CSS, like font-family: Arial, sans-serif;, the browser displays it using the font already installed on the user’s device.

Custom Web Fonts:

Custom web fonts (like Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts) are not installed on the user's device by default. Instead, they are downloaded via the web when the page loads.

Examples:

Roboto

Open Sans

Lato

Montserrat

How they work:

They are typically loaded using @font-face or linked via a <link> tag from services like Google Fonts:

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}


Why Might You Use a Web-Safe Font Over a Custom Font?

Web-safe fonts don’t need to be downloaded, so pages load more quickly.

Guaranteed to work on all devices without fallback issues.

No need for internet connection to load fonts from Google/Adobe.

Ideal for basic sites, emails, or when custom branding isn’t needed.
