what is a program ?
 a program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that can computer understand and excute to prforming this task.

 LAB EXERCISE: Write a simple "Hello World" program in two different programming languages 
of your choice. Compare the structure and syntax. 

 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en">
 <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
 </head>
 <body>
    <h1>hello world</h1>
 </body>
 </html>

 print("hello world"); 

  first is in html and second is in python.html is used to create web pages and python is a programming language used for various applications.

  THEORY EXERCISE: Explain in your own words what a program is and how it functions. 
What is Programming?

 program is a set of instructions in writing format in that can computer understand and execute to perform task.

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that a computer can follow to perform specific tasks. like java,python,c++ etc.

functions:
write code
save code
run code
give output

THEORY EXERCISE: What are the key steps involved in the programming process? 
Types of Programming Languages

1.uderstanding the problem
2.planning the solution
3.writing the code  
4.testing the code
5.debugging the code
6.maintaining the code
7.running the code

type of programming languages:
1. High-level languages: These are user-friendly languages that are easy to read and write, such as Python, Java, and C++.
2. Low-level languages: These languages are closer to machine code and are harder for humans to read, such as Assembly language.    
3. Scripting languages: These are used for automating tasks and writing scripts, such as JavaScript, Perl, and Ruby.
4. Markup languages: These are used to format and present data, such as HTML and XML.

THEORY EXERCISE: What are the main differences between high-level and low-level 
programming languages?

  high-level :
1. Easier to read and write for humans.
2. Abstracts away hardware details. 
3. easy to learn and use.
4. Examples  Python, Java, and C++.

low-level :
1. Closer to machine code, harder for humans to read.
2. Requires knowledge of hardware details.
3. More difficult to learn and use.
4. Examples: Assembly language and machine code.

www:
this is a world wide web, it is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the internet. It allows users to view and interact with content such as text, images, and videos through web browsers.

created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.
uses in http to connect and share information.

how internet works:
1. A user types a URL into a web browser.
2. The browser sends a request to a web server to access the requested page.
3. The web server processes the request and sends back the requested page.
4. The browser receives the page and renders it for the user to view.


LAB EXERCISE: Research and create a diagram of how data is transmitted from a client to a 
server over the internet.

1. Client sends a request to the server.
2. The request is sent over the internet through various routers and switches.
3. The server receives the request and processes it.
4. The server sends a response back to the client.
5. The response travels back through the internet to the client.
6. The client receives the response and displays it in the web browser.


THEORY EXERCISE: Describe the roles of the client and server in web communication. 
Network Layers on Client and Serve.

The client is usually a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) running on your computer or mobile device. It sends requests to the server asking for web content (like web pages, images, or data).

The server is a powerful computer that stores website files and responds to client requests. When a client asks for a page, the server processes the request and sends back the right data.

Client and Server in Web Communication:
this is run based on osi(open systems interconnections) model.

network-layer:Decides the best path for data to travel (uses IP).

THEORY EXERCISE: Explain the function of the TCP/IP model and its layers. 
Client and Servers 

1. Network Access Layer
Handles physical network connections (Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
Ensures data can be sent and received over the network.
 2. Internet Layer	
Routes the data from one computer to another across networks. like IP (Internet Protocol) 
3. Transport Layer
Ensures reliable delivery of data, in correct order.like tcp and udp.
4. Application Layer
Supports user services like web, email, file transfer.like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS

THEORY EXERCISE: Explain Client Server Communication 
Types of Internet Connections 

A client server communications is a client sends a request to a server.The server processes the request and sends back a response.
  
Types of Internet Connections:
dial-up
dsl
fiber optic
satellite

LAB EXERCISE: Research different types of internet connections (e.g., broadband, fiber, 
satellite) and list their pros and cons. 

dial-up:
Pros:Available in rural areas,Cheap
Cons:Slow speeds

DLS :
pros:windly Available,better than dial-up
cons:slower than cable/fiber,Speed depends on distance from ISP

fiber optic:
pros: Extremely fast,Stable and reliable
cons:expensive,high-latency

satellite:
pron:work in remote places,no cable needs
cons:expensive,high-latency

THEORY EXERCISE: How does broadband differ from fiber-optic internet? 
Protocols 

broadband:
A general term for high-speed internet
Varies (slower than fiber)
Uses copper cables, phone lines, or coaxial cables
Higher latency than fiber
Can be affected by weather or interference
Usually cheaper
Widely available, even in rural areas

fiber-optic:
A specific type of broadband using fiber-optic cables
Extremely fast (up to 1 Gbps or more)
Uses glass or plastic fibers that transmit light
Very low latency (good for gaming, video calls)
Very reliable and consistent performance
More expensive but cost is reducing
Limited in rural areas, expanding in cities

 Common Internet Protocols:
 HTTP
 https
 ftp
 ip
 TCP
 udp


 THEORY EXERCISE: What are the differences between HTTP and HTTPS protocols? 
Application Security

http:
HyperText Transfer Protocol
Not secure (data is in plain text)
Port 80
Internal or non-sensitive sites
No padlock icon in browser

https:
HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
Secure (data is encrypted)
Port 443

application security:
Verifying a user's identity ( login)
Ensuring data is protected ( encryption)
Ensuring data is not tampered with ( checksums)
Ensuring data is available when needed ( backups)
